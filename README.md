# Programming assignment 3 (pa03)

Implement the requested activity and the optional activity in Traceroute.pdf.

Since it was similar to our UDP pinger, but with ICMP, I gave you the solution to the ICMPping.pdf (IcmpPing.py) for your reference. 

Further, since the ICMP wireshark lab is relevant, I have included it (you don't have to submit anything for it though).

Please submit code and screenshots of it running, and include in the image the command you use to run/launch the program, ports, ip addresses, etc.
